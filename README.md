## A Frontend for Helsinki Activities

This project was inspired by https://open-api.myhelsinki.fi/ API. It uses this to create a view to help to find nearby activities. The activities can be filtered by their tags to make searching for activities of interest easier. Only activities with any active tag will be displayed. By default, all events are displayed.


The deployed product can be found at http://www.inhelsinki.fi/. 

## Running Locally

After successfully cloning the repository, navigate to it and run the following commands in the terminal:

```
npm install
npm run-script build
npm run
```

This should open a browser tab https://localhost:5000 with the website running.
